Final project for CS 296, an text-based adventure game by Lucas Message.



ABOUT:
=====

Haunted House is a game of strategy, endless puzzles, challenging bosses
and hopeless romances, or so I envisioned it. It is actually a very sim-
ple game that helped me learn Clojure.


HOW TO PLAY:
===========

Your goal is to find a rare item by defeating the boss.

To see all the commands in the game, type "help".
