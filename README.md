ABOUT:
=====

Haunted House is a game of strategy, endless puzzles, challenging bosses
and hopeless romances, or so I envisioned it. It is actually a very sim-
ple game that helped me learn Clojure.


HOW TO PLAY:
===========

Your goal is to find a rare item by defeating the boss.

To see all the commands in the game, type "help".

study.

2. Go to the master bedroom and use all four items that you found.

3. Dance.

4. Climb to the attic.
